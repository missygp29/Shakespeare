# Shakespeare
Shakespeare!

I love him. I grew up with a parent who loved him, who moved to London so that she could watch more Shakespeare productions, and who took me to many, many versions of Hamlet. And I know my teenaged self was not the only teenager ever to find him compelling. 

So, I wanted to put together this page (admittedly, a project at school for my MSLIS) as a guide for any teen who thinks that Shakespeare might be for them. This is a list of resources that will hopefully provide further understanding of Shakespeare and the breadth and depth of meaning we can get from him work. There are articles, books, adaptations (updates and movies), podcasts, fun things that people have done on the internet, and more. It also does not hide the way in which Shakespeare's works are problematic - there are critical readings, particularly with respect to race. I hope you enjoy!

I used skills gained in Rachel Daniell's Information Technologies class at Pratt Institute's School of Information. I brought in an API from The Folger Shakespeare Library and used javaScript to pull in random words and characters from that. I tried to find a random quote generator but I couldn't, so I built a limited one for myself from a small number that I enjoyed.
